# Q5
#
# Paper and wood products companies need to define cutting schedules that will
# maximize the total wood yield of their forests over some planning period.
# Suppose that a firm with control of 2 forest units wants to identify the
# best cutting schedule over a planning horizon of 3 years. Forest unit 1 has
# a total acreage of 2 and unit 2 has a total of 3 acres. The studies that the
# company has undertaken predict that each acre in unit 1(2) will have
# 1, 1.3, 1.4 (1, 1.2, 1.6) tons of woods per acre available for harvesting
# in year 1, 2, 3 respectively. Based on its prediction of economic conditions,
# the company believes that it should harvest at least 1.2, 1.5, 2 tons of
# wood in year 1, 2, 3 separately. Due to the availability of equipment and
# personnel, the company can harvest at most 2, 2, 3 tons of wood in
# year 1, 2, 3. Find the companyâ€™s best cutting strategy that maximizes the
# total weights of wood. Here discounting of the time value should not be
# considered.  If some fraction of a forest unit is cut down in year 1, that
# part of the forest cannot be cut again for the remaining 2 years.  Similarly
# if some fraction of the forest unit is cut down in year 2 it cannot be cut
# in year 3.
#
# In year 3, how many acres of forest unit 2 should be cut down?  Round to
# 2 decimal places.
